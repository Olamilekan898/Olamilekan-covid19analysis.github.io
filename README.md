....... INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization project! This repository offers a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 data, providing valuable insights into the global pandemic. Through meticulous analysis and visualization techniques, this project aims to enhance understanding of key metrics, trends, and dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak.

....... KEY FEATURES

- *Comprehensive Metrics Analysis:* The project examines total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, highlighting the scale and impact of the pandemic.
- *Crucial Rate Calculations:* Using various DAX functions, we calculate and analyze rates such as recovery and mortality rates, offering insights into healthcare response effectiveness:
  - *Cumulative New Cases:* SUM('COVID DATA'[New cases])
  - *Cumulative New Deaths:* SUM('COVID DATA'[New deaths])
  - *Mortality Rate (%):* SUM('COVID DATA'[Deaths]) / SUM('COVID DATA'[Covid 19 Confirmed Cases]) * 100
  - *Recovery Rate (%):* SUM('COVID DATA'[Recovered]) / SUM('COVID DATA'[Covid 19 Confirmed Cases]) * 100
  - *Total Confirmed Cases:* SUM('COVID DATA'[Covid 19 Confirmed Cases])
  - *Total Deaths:* SUM('COVID DATA'[Deaths])
  - *Total Recovered:* SUM('COVID DATA'[Recovered])
  - *Average Death Rate:* AVERAGEX('COVID DATA', [Total Deaths])
  - *Average Confirmed Cases:* AVERAGEX('COVID DATA', [Total Confirmed Cases])
  - *Average Recovered:* AVERAGEX('COVID DATA', [Total Recovered])
- *Advanced Visualization Techniques:* Line charts illustrate trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
- *Insightful KPI Charts:* KPI charts highlight monthly disparities between confirmed and new cases, providing a nuanced perspective on the outbreak's evolution.
- *Interactive Features:* An image in the visualization allows users to reset selections (unselect a sliver) by simply pressing Ctrl + A and clicking the COVID image.

...... PROJECTED GOALS

- Provide a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic through data analysis and visualization.
- Derive actionable insights from complex datasets to aid decision-making and response efforts.
- Facilitate ongoing monitoring and assessment of the pandemic's global impact.
