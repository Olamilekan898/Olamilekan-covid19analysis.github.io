COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Project


INTRODUCTION: Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization project! This repository hosts a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 data, aiming to provide valuable insights into the global pandemic landscape. Through meticulous analysis and visualization techniques, this project offers a deeper understanding of key metrics, trends, and dynamics surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak.
Key Features:
•	Comprehensive Metrics Analysis: The project meticulously examines key metrics, including total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, shedding light on the scale and impact of the pandemic.
•	
•	*Calculation of Crucial Rates: Using Various DAX functions i was able to use measures to examine Crucial rates and other calculations such as the recovery rate and mortality rate are calculated and analyzed, offering insights into the effectiveness of response efforts and healthcare systems.
•	Which are as follows
•	
•	FOR CUMMULATED NEW CASES = SUM('COVID DATA'[New cases])
•	CUMMULATED NEW DEATH = SUM('COVID DATA'[New deaths])
•	MORTALITY RATE % = sum('COVID DATA'[Deaths])/sum('COVID DATA'[Covid 19 Confirmed Cases])*100
•	RECOVERY RATE % = SUM('COVID DATA'[Recovered])/SUM('COVID DATA'[Covid 19 Confirmed Cases])*100
•	TOTAL NUMBER OF CONFIRMED CASE = SUM('COVID DATA'[Covid 19 Confirmed Cases])
•	TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS = SUM('COVID DATA'[Deaths])
•	TOTAL NUMBER OF RECOVERED = SUM('COVID DATA'[Recovered])
•	Advanced Visualization Techniques: Utilizing advanced measures and visualization techniques, the project employs line charts to illustrate trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
•	Insightful KPI Charts: Key Performance Indicator (KPI) charts are leveraged to highlight disparities between confirmed and new cases at the beginning of each month, providing a nuanced perspective on the evolving nature of the outbreak.


PROJECTED GOALS :
•	To provide a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic landscape through data analysis and visualization.
•	To derive actionable insights from complex datasets, contributing to informed decision-making and response efforts.
•	To facilitate ongoing monitoring and assessment of the pandemic's progression and impact on a global scale.
